- How to check your code with `PEP 8`

## Requirements

- Python 3.4

- pep8 1.7

  * program should be exactly 5 lines long



**[7-edges.py](7-edges.py)** - Complete the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/7-edges.py) such that:

  * `word_first_3` contains the first 3 letters of the variable `word`

  * `word_last_2` contains the last 2 letters of the variable `word`

  * `middle_word` contains the value of the variable `word` without the first and last letters

  * not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements

  * program should be exactly 8 lines long



**[8-concat_edges.py](8-concat_edges.py)** - Complete the [source code](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00.py/blob/master/8-concat_edges.py) in order to print `object-oriented programming with Python`, followed by a new line.

  * not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements

  * program should be exactly 5 lines long

  * not allowed to create new variables

  * not allowed to use string literals



**[9-easter_egg.py](9-easter_egg.py)** - Write a Python script that prints "The Zen of Python", by TimPeters, followed by a new line.

  * script should be maximum 98 characters long


**[10-check_cycle.c](10-check_cycle.c)** - Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

Prototype: int check_cycle(listint_t *list);

Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle

Requirements:

Only these functions are allowed: write, printf, putchar, puts, malloc, free

**[lists.h](lists.h)** - Technical interview preparation:

You are not allowed to google anything

Whiteboard first

This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solution’s runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc.



### Advanced

**[100-write.py](100-write.py)** - Write a Python script that prints exactly `and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19`, followed by a new line.

  * Use the function `write` from the `sys` module

  * not allowed to use `print`

  * script should print to `stderr`

  * script should exit with the status code `1`



**[101-compile](101-compile)** - Write a script that compiles a Python script file. The Python file name will be stored in the environment variable `$PYFILE`. The output filename has to be `$PYFILEc` (ex: `export PYFILE=my_main.py` => output filename: `my_main.pyc`)



**[102-magic_calculation.py](102-magic_calculation.py)** - Write a Python function `def magic_calculation(a, b):` that does exactly the same as the following Python bytecode:

```

 3		0 LOAD_CONST               1 (98)

              	3 LOAD_FAST                0 (a)

              	6 LOAD_FAST                1 (b)

              	9 BINARY_POWER

             	10 BINARY_ADD

             	11 RETURN_VALUE

```
